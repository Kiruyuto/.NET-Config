# .NET-Config
Personal set of rules and analyzers distributed as a NuGet package to share configuration across .NET projects.

**Heavily** based on [Gérald Barré (@Meziantou)](https://github.com/meziantou)'s "*Sharing coding style and Roslyn analyzers across projects*" [post](https://www.meziantou.net/sharing-coding-style-and-roslyn-analyzers-across-projects.htm) and his [CodingStandard](https://github.com/meziantou/Meziantou.DotNet.CodingStandard) repository.  
This config contains rules changed and fine-tuned to my personal and work needs as well as preferences.
